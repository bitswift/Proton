 * To create a subclass:
 *
 *  1. Declare and synthesize any properties desired. Properties can be
 *  `readwrite`, in which case they will generate transformations (see below).
 *  2. Implement key-value coding validation methods
 *  (per the semantics of `validateValue:forKey:error:`) as desired. These
 *  validation methods will be automatically invoked by <initWithDictionary:>.
 *  3. Override <initWithDictionary:> if you need to verify object consistency
 *  after it has been initialized.
 *
 * Subclasses do not need to implement `<NSCoding>`, `<NSCopying>`, `-hash`, or
 * `isEqual:`. The implementations of all of these methods are based on the
 * <initWithDictionary:> and <dictionaryValue> behaviors of the class.
 *
 * @warning **Important:** Subclasses of this class are expected to be
 * immutable. To preserve the contract of immutability, but still allow
 * convenient usage, `PROModel` will disable any `@property` setters outside of
 * normal usage, but will allow them to be used with <[PROModel performTransformation:]>.
