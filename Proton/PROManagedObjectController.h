/**
 * Coordinates the editing of an `NSManagedObject`, and allows views and view
 * controllers to bind to its properties.
 *
 * This class provides built-in support for undo grouping, using <groupsByEdit>,
 * and for managed object context operations, using <saveOnCommitEditing> and
 * <rollbackOnDiscardEditing>.
 *
 * This class conforms to the `<NSEditor>` and `<NSEditorRegistration>` informal
 * protocols on Mac OS X.
 *
 * Instances of this class will automatically remove themselves from the default
 * `NSNotificationCenter` upon deallocation.
 *
 * @warning **Important:** This class is not safe to use from multiple threads
 * simultaneously. It can be used on background threads if only accessed from
 * one thread at a time.
