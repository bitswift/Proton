 * A base class for presentation model objects.
 *
 * To create a subclass:
 *
 *  1. Declare and synthesize any properties desired. Properties should be
 *  `readwrite` (even if exposed as `readonly`) so that their values can be set
 *  with key-value coding.
 *  2. Override `setModel:` to tear down and set up bindings from the <model>.
 *
 * Subclasses do not need to implement `<NSCoding>`, `<NSCopying>`, `-hash`, or
 * `isEqual:`. The implementations of all of these methods are based on the
 * <initWithDictionary:> and <dictionaryValue> behaviors of the class.
 *
 * Upon deallocation, instances of this class will automatically invoke
 * <[NSObject removeAllOwnedObservers]> and <[PROBinding
 * removeAllBindingsFromOwner:>, and automatically unregister from any
 * notifications from the default `NSNotificationCenter`.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe.
